# Discord Bot for the Tucson International Christian Church server

### Purpose:

- Maintain access for repeating tasks of server members through slash commands
- Allow administration to keep the server clean and orderly
- Quality of life features

### Features:

1. **Announcement:** A slash command that allows administrators to send a text message to the #announcement channel with the `/announcement` command. Requests an announcement message.

2. **Quiet-Time:** A slash command that allows members of the church to share their quiet times easily to the #quiet-time channel with `/quiet-time`. Requests a starting verse, ending verse, additional scriptures (not required), and a summary.

3. **Share Scripture:** Sometimes, members might want to share a certain scripture. The `/share-scripture` command requests the verse, the scripture (copy & paste from the bible), and a summary/message about the scripture.

### Work In Progress Features:

1. **Disciple Tracking:** It gets hard to keep track of all the disciple's birthdays and their spiritual birthdays (Day of baptism). A command that new disciples can call, possibly `/new-disciple`, would request the new disciple's birthday and their spiritual birthday. The bot will then keep track of those dates and ping the server upon those dates.

2. **Role Assignments:** A drop menu accessed through `/role` that will allow users to select roles from what channels they wish to receive pings for to access to certain chats for brothers or sisters, etc.

### Setup:

If you wish to download this bot for your own church server, please contact me, either through my email or another member of the church. I'm currently hosting by myself, so I'm unable to set the bot to public.
